Hip & Groin,Anterior Hip,Iliopsoas/Rectus Femoris Tendinopathy,Tendon,minorInjury,"Hills may be an issue, progress back with them slowly. Try loading hip flexors in supine first, before standing. Load eccentrically as well, try A-skips before running again."

Hip & Groin,Lateral Hip,"Gluteal Maximus, Minimus, Medius Tendinopathy",Tendon,minorInjury,"Load in hip extension, abduction heavily and progress to plyometrics. Start with volume first, avoid overstriding increase cadence before speed if possible. Running drills would be helpful. "
Hip & Groin,Lateral Hip,Proximal Iliotibial Fasciopathy,Tendon,minorInjury,"May be a directional issue on the camber for track athletes, hip adduction during running. Compression of fascia from both passive and active structures (glute med/min/TFL). Introduce trails on flat, before progressing to uphill and downhill. Speed can precede volume in this injury. "
